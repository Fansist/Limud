### Fixed - Landing Page (Homescreen) Buttons Not Working

**Problem**: Most buttons on the landing page (homescreen) did not work. Navigation links, FAQ accordion, pricing CTAs, "Try Live Demo", "See How It Works", and the back-to-top button were all unresponsive.

**Root Cause**: The `FloatingParticles` component used `Math.random()` during render to generate inline styles. Since `Math.random()` produces different values on server vs client, React detected a hydration mismatch on every page load. When React encounters such mismatches, it can fail to properly attach event handlers to the DOM — making all interactive elements (buttons, links, accordions) non-functional even though they appeared correctly on screen.

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **`FloatingParticles` hydration fix** (`src/components/landing/LandingPage.tsx`)
   - **Before**: Generated random particle positions/sizes during render (runs on both SSR and client with different `Math.random()` results)
   - **After**: Deferred all random generation to a `useEffect` hook (client-only). Renders an empty placeholder `<div>` during SSR/before mount, then populates particles on client mount. This eliminates the hydration mismatch entirely.

2. **Smooth scroll for navigation anchor links** (`src/components/landing/LandingPage.tsx`)
   - **Before**: Used plain `<a href="#section">` which may not reliably smooth-scroll in Next.js SPA context
   - **After**: Added `scrollToSection()` handler using `element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })` applied to all 5 desktop nav links, 5 mobile nav links, "See How It Works" hero button, and "View Pricing" CTA button

3. **Scroll offset for fixed navbar** (`src/app/globals.css`)
   - Added `scroll-margin-top: 80px` on `[id]` elements so anchored sections don't hide behind the fixed navbar
   - Added `scroll-behavior: smooth` on `:root` as a global CSS fallback

### Verified Working - All Landing Page Buttons

## [4.1.1] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed - Broken Buttons in Teacher Pages (Demo Mode)

**Problem**: Most action buttons across teacher pages did not work. Only navigation links (redirecting to other pages) functioned correctly. Action buttons that triggered API calls or state changes would fail silently because they attempted to call authenticated API endpoints without a valid session.

**Root Cause**: In demo mode (`?demo=true`), there is no authenticated session. Button handlers that made `fetch()` calls to `/api/*` endpoints would receive `401 Unauthorized` responses. Several pages lacked demo-mode fallback logic for their action buttons.

**Fixes Applied**:

1. **`/teacher/assignments` - "Create Assignment" button**
   - **Before**: `handleCreate()` always POSTed to `/api/assignments` (returns 401 in demo)
   - **After**: Added `isDemo` check that creates a local demo assignment object, adds it to state, and shows a success toast
   - Affected button: "Create Assignment" in the modal dialog

2. **`/teacher/games` - Missing DashboardLayout wrapper**
   - **Before**: Page rendered without `<DashboardLayout>`, causing it to appear without sidebar navigation, header, or demo banner
   - **After**: Wrapped entire component (including loading state) in `<DashboardLayout>`
   - Affected: Game toggle buttons and overall page layout

3. **`/teacher/quiz-generator` - "Generate" button (demo mode)**
   - **Before**: Demo mode only showed a toast but did NOT actually create a quiz or add it to the list
   - **After**: Generates a full demo quiz object with sample questions, adds it to the quiz list, and selects it for preview
   - Affected button: "Generate" button in the quiz form

### Verified Working - All Teacher Page Buttons

| Page | Button/Action | Status |
|------|--------------|--------|
| `/teacher/dashboard` | AI Lesson Planner, Create Assignment, Quick Actions | ✅ Links work |
| `/teacher/assignments` | Create Assignment (modal + submit) | ✅ Fixed |

| `/teacher/intelligence` | Auto-assign, AI Intervention, Tab switcher | ✅ Working |
| `/teacher/quiz-generator` | Generate, Select quiz, Subject/Grade selectors | ✅ Fixed |
| `/teacher/lesson-planner` | Generate New Plan, Favorite, Copy, Expand | ✅ Working |
| `/teacher/insights` | Data display (no action buttons) | ✅ Working |
| `/teacher/reports` | Generate Report, Analyze Writing, Print, Export | ✅ Working |
| `/teacher/students` | Student cards (click to view detail), Search, Filter | ✅ Working |
| `/teacher/analytics` | Search, Score distribution (data display) | ✅ Working |
| `/teacher/games` | Game toggle per classroom | ✅ Fixed |

## [4.1.0] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed - Critical Runtime Errors

1. **Runtime TypeError: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')"**
   - **Root cause**: Next.js 15.5.2 paired with React 18.3.1 (incompatible - Next.js 15 requires React 19)
   - **Fix**: Downgraded to Next.js 14.2.21 (fully compatible with React 18)
   - **Files changed**: `package.json`, `next.config.js`
   - Updated `next.config.js` for Next.js 14 (`serverComponentsExternalPackages` moved to `experimental`)

2. **Service Worker: "Failed to execute 'clone' on 'Response': Response body is already used"**
   - **Root cause**: `sw.js` consumed response body then tried to clone it
   - **Fix**: Clone request before fetch, wrap `response.clone()` in try-catch, bumped cache to `limud-v3`
   - **File changed**: `public/sw.js`

3. **Quiz Generator: "[object Object] is not valid JSON"**
   - **Root cause**: API returned `questions` as already-parsed array, client called `JSON.parse()` on it
   - **Fix**: Added `safeParseQuestions()` helper that handles both string and array formats
   - **File changed**: `src/app/teacher/quiz-generator/page.tsx`

4. **Favicon 500 errors on every page load**
   - **Root cause**: Duplicate `favicon.ico` in both `public/` and `src/app/` caused Next.js conflict
   - **Fix**: Removed `src/app/favicon.ico`, keeping only `public/favicon.ico`

5. **Missing Suspense boundaries for `useSearchParams()`**
   - Added `layout.tsx` with `<Suspense>` wrappers for 16+ pages that were missing them
   - Prevents SSR hydration issues with Next.js 14 App Router

6. **`callOpenAI` Object.assign hack**
   - Removed fragile `Object.assign(content, { content })` pattern, now returns plain string

7. **`next.config.js` deprecated `images.domains`**
   - Replaced with `images.remotePatterns` for proper configuration

### Changed
- AI model updated to `gpt-4o-mini` with configurable `OPENAI_BASE_URL` support
